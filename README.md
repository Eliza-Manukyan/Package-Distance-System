# Package-Distance-System

## Overview

The Vehicle Distance Monitoring System is a simple program that processes data from ultrasonic sensors attached to a vehicle. It checks the distance from obstacles and provides warnings if the vehicle is too close.

## Features

- **Process Sensor Data:** Analyzes data from ultrasonic sensors and makes decisions based on the distance.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler:

   ```bash
   gcc VehicleDistanceMonitoring.c -o VehicleDistanceMonitoring
   ```

2. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./VehicleDistanceMonitoring
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the number of sensors and their data.
